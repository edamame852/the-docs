# Terminologies
1. ABG: Arterial Blood Gases
2. ACP: Anatomical Cellular Pathology
3. Whisk away: Shaun people away
4. H&E : H stain (hematoxylin for nucleus, bluish-purple) + E stain (Eosin red ish for everything else)
5. ZN dye: Ziehl-Neelsen, needs heat-fix by Bunsen burner, ZN is good for cells with high lipid on cell wall (i.e.waxy)
    - acid -> nonacid-fast cell, turns methylene blue/malachite green = de-coloration by Carbol Fuchsin!
    - acid -> acid-fast cells =  resist de-coloration by acids (i.e. acid fast = acid holding = acid resistant)
5. Hiso Technician: For cutting sample (to embed into wax blob and stain, + alcohol)
6. Cyto technician: Junior won't see, read easy pap smears
7. Slide: under the microscope
8. 

# Cyto. vs Hiso.
- Histo. is more tissue arch, blob -> cut
- Cyto. is more burst of cells (ie. blood drawn)

# Case 1: Well def stomach cancer, high grade dysplasia -> nothing

# Case 2: Infarction (=blockage) on placenta - purple Ca2+ patch, 6cm large tumor but only took 1 block (of sample).

# Case 3: Plasma Cell = B lymphocyte final cell differential
## Found in Endometrium (internal uterine lining), limited significance for blocking pregnancy
= Chronic endometriosis
## Prescribe anti-inflammatory medication

# Case 4: Trisomy 18
- shit cardiovascular system
- baby of 14 weeks (Gestation) (non-still born since not 22/24 weeks old = age of viability)
- Usually refer to : Dead B
- Heart need prof to see, mid May fam back for visit

# Case 5: Lung, large tumor (not adenocarcinoma/ squamous carcinoma), This is small-cell carcinoma (endocrine shit) (neo-endocrine - nuero related)
- Consulted Amy, Dr. Yu, another consultant
- very high grade = chur cancer (an epithelial)
- chemical therapy, not operable 
- 40's men
- Caused neo-endocrine = which is neuro-related

- Types of epithelial
    - Shape
        - simple (=1 layer) cubital
        - simple cumuli (=long rectangle)
        - psuedo stratify (= )
        - stratify (=n-layer)
        - ...

- Extra:
    - adenocarcinoma: more middle aged women, usually non-smoker, could be related to cooking oil
    - squamous (鱗狀) carcinoma: smokers
    - epithelial: gland/ squamous (mainly 2 types)
        - cervix has both gland (= endo)/squamous (= outer)
        - Intestine: gland
        - tongue's histology: gland

# Whole dissection flow
Sample arrive -> Paraffin -> formalin fixing -> cut by MO -> get piece -> color outer later in Indian ink (outer layer) -> place into 3*2*0.5 cassette -> technician work (machine process, gap into wax/paraffin block, trim down, dip H&E stain, add cover slip) -> see cancer -> marker mark 


# Indian Ink vs Marker
Indian ink (blue af) (just paint) - pre-dissect
Permanent Marker - post-dissect


# Paraffin section vs frozen section
- Frozen - lost of detail but quick af. N2(l), happens when patient is open on the table (intra-operative decision)
- Paraffin (wax) not oil - More long term solution
- In the event of mis-frozen section, unfrozen then paraffin sample, the stain resolution will also decrease
