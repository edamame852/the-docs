1. ABG: Arterial Blood Gases
2. ACP: Anatomical Cellular Pathology
3. Whisk away: Shaun people away
4. H&E : H stain (hematoxylin for nucleus, bluish-purple) + E stain (Eosin red ish for everything else)
5. Hiso Technician: For cutting sample (to embed into wax blob and stain, + alcohol)
6. Cyto technician: Junior won't see, read easy pap smears
7. Slide: under the microscope

# Cyto. vs Hiso.
- Histo. is more tissue arch, blob -> cut; Cyto. is more burst of cells (ie. blood drawn)

# Case 1: Well def stomach cancer, high grade dysplasia -> nothing

# Case 2: Infarction (=blockage) on placenta - purple Ca2+ patch, 6cm large tumor but only took 1 block.

# Indian Ink vs Marker
Indian ink (blue af) - pre-dissect
Marker - pos-dissect

# Paraffin section vs frozen section
Frozen - lost of detail but quick af. N2 (l), happens when patient is open on the table (intra-operative decision)
Paraffin (wax) not oil -
