# Terminologies
1. ABG: Arterial Blood Gases
2. ACP: Anatomical Cellular Pathology
3. Whisk away: Shaun people away
4. H&E : H stain (hematoxylin for nucleus, bluish-purple) + E stain (Eosin red ish for everything else)
5. ZN dye: Ziehl-Neelsen, needs heat-fix by Bunsen burner, ZN is good for cells with high lipid on cell wall (i.e.waxy)
    - acid -> nonacid-fast cell, turns methylene blue/malachite green = decoloration by Carbol Fuchsin!
    - acid -> acid-fast cells =  resist decoloration by acids (i.e. acid fast = acid holding = acid resistant)
5. Hiso Technician: For cutting sample (to embed into wax blob and stain, + alcohol)
6. Cyto technician: Junior won't see, read easy pap smears
7. Slide: under the microscope
8. 

# Cyto. vs Hiso.
- Histo. is more tissue arch, blob -> cut; Cyto. is more burst of cells (ie. blood drawn)

# Case 1: Well def stomach cancer, high grade dysplasia -> nothing

# Case 2: Infarction (=blockage) on placenta - purple Ca2+ patch, 6cm large tumor but only took 1 block (of sample).

# Case 3: Plasma Cell = B lymphocyte final cell differential
## Found in Endometrium (internal uterine lining), limited significance for blocking pregnancy
= Chronic endometriosis
## Prescribe anti-inflammatory medication

# Case 4: 



# Indian Ink vs Marker
Indian ink (blue af) - pre-dissect
Marker - pos-dissect

# Paraffin section vs frozen section
Frozen - lost of detail but quick af. N2(l), happens when patient is open on the table (intra-operative decision)
Paraffin (wax) not oil - More long term solution
