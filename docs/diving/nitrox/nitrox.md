# Enriched Air Diver
## Introducing EANx (Enriched Air Nitrox)
- Main goal is to increase no stop/no decompression dive time
- In the past a new table is needed for different blends of EANx to calculate the correct oxygen exposure but now computers calculate it all

{:.note}
>Jargon time: nitrox = EAN = EANx = enriched air are all used interchangably

## Diving with Nitrox
- Purpose is not to have more O2 but to have LESS N2
