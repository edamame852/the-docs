# Enriched Air Diver
## Introducing EANx (Enriched Air Nitrox)
- Main goal is to increase no stop/no decompression dive time
- In the past a new table is needed for different blends of EANx to calculate the correct oxygen exposure but now computers calculate it all

{:.note}
>Jargon time: nitrox = EAN = EANx = enriched air are all used interchangably

## Diving with Nitrox
- Purpose is not to have more O2 but to have LESS N2
- EANx36 = nitrox with 36% O2 = Nitrox 36

### Benefits of using Nitrox
- Extending allowable bottom time (added no stop time in repeated dives)
- Reducing the need to suck in more air when near no decompression limit (Reducing N2 affect)
- Reduce overall N2 load during multiple dives

| Depth (meters)   |No decompression limit time(Air)   | No decompression limit time (EANx32)   |No decompression limit time (EANx36) |
| -------- | ------- | ------- |------- |
| 0m / on-land  | inf  | inf    |   inf    |
| 18m | 56 mins   |  95 mins     |  125 mins   |
| 22m   | 37 mins    |  60 mins    |  70 mins    | 

- DCI (Decompression sickness) rate of normal air is the same as nitrox diving, nitrox also does NOT reduce the risk for narcosis

## Gears

### Nitrox-tailored gears
- High O2 blended gas can cause equipments to deteriorate rapidly
- Typically, according to NOAA, US Navy, OSHA, ... scuba eqipuments can use up to EANx40 without any modifications
- For EANx40 and above, equipments including cylinders will be cleaned to O2 service specs, luburicated, comptaible O-rings ... is required

### Nitrox cylinders
- Is to be cleaned under local law or standards
- In US: Enriched air cylinders and regulars rated for 300 bar are O2 service rated
- In Europe: Standard requires special valve and regulators for eqipments such as the M26x2 

### Caution when using Nitrox
- 1. Mark non-nitrox and nitrox tanks seperately!


## Nitrox class

### Nitrox license pros and cons:

pros:
- longer no decompression limit (NDL)
- longer and deeper dives
- N2 sickness
- can replace emergency O2 
- Feels better
- Shorter surface interval

limit for nitrox: 
- N2 saturation
- ran out of gas

cons:
- Oxygen posioning
- Fire hazard
- More expansive
- rest time higher
- Storage fee
- Maintance fee (eqipment)
- More annoying (set watch, fill in air full log)

### Causes for NDL
- Fast ascend
- Over NDL time

Gas necrosis: includes both N2 and O2
- Whereas the canto version only includes Nitrogen
- will lower ciritcal thinking

### Shit diving watch
- Taiwan Atom mission 1 = no warning for NDL

### Nitrox eqipments
High O2 environment = more oxidization
- Green O ring
- Yellow bottle, green-yellow sticker 
- oxygen clean service sticker (NEVER SEEN)
- Enriched Air filled data sticker from PADI (NEVER SEEN) : Typically, just a normal sticker with marker
- Black and white strips at the top

- PADI Tec Gas Blender license 

### Nitrox percentage
- 32% (More common)
- 36%

### Oxygen exposure

In different pressure, different performence of gases

PO2 and pp (They're the same)
1 bar *0.21 = 0.21 pp (in normal pressure)

We cannot exceed 1.4 and 1.6
- 1.4 ata/bar = no chance of O2 positioning, the risk occurs after 1.4
- 1.6 ata/bar = potentially O2 posioning
- after 1.6 ata/bar = definately Oxygen posioning

### Oxygen posioning
- CNS posioning (immdiately)
    - Will lead to seizures (in the face), regulator gets loose and suffocate and die
-  Symptoms (6 of them):
    - tunnel vision
    - seizure
    - anxiety
    - dizzyness
    - ear blaring
    - tendency to vomit

Please contact your buddy and perform a normal ascend

### Control O2 exposure
- Set computer and dive within limit
- Know your pp/ po2 limit

### O2 analysis form (Enriched Air Fill log)
- Must be filled every dive
    - Tank Cylinder number (around the rim, but there's usually another common number written by the dive shop (usually in 1 or 2 digits))
    - date where diver receives container 
    - dive shop name/ dive operation
    - oxygen analysis (final nitrox percentage)
    - blender's name 
    - Max depth @ 1.4 
    - cylinder pressure
    - divers name
    - diver's signiture 
- Tuner (set oxygen percentage first), blow the nitrox to the o-ring and try = analysis done

### CR-5L dive watch
Menu > settings > set dive > scbua > set gas


### Dive Watch setting (Use of tecnology)
1. Gas necrosis
2. Dive within the limit of dive watch
3. Every dive should have their own dive watch, due to different concentration of nitrox
4. Execute safety stop as usual

4 off 5 in for nitrox percentage

During live aboard (on ship)
- Still need to adjust your dive watch
- Becareful: Since it might default back to 21% (normal air) while some might withhold for 12 hours

{:.warning}
> Backup watch:
> Only counts if you dive with it and adjusted it before the dive


The majority of dive watches can use both nitrox and air

### Safety Factor 
+1 more conservative
+2 Extremely conservative

### Amount of oxygen given during an accident
- pure oxygen / high nitrox can help with DCI
- Do CPR (when there's no breathing)
- call EMS
- Hold regulator and ascend safely

### pp/ PO2 table vs depth

| Pressure (bar) | Depth (meters)   | 21% O2 (AIR) | 40% O2|36% O2| 35% O2| 32% O2 |
| -------- | -------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | 
| 1 bar | 0m / on-land   |  0.21pp   |   0.40pp    |  0.36pp    |  0.35pp    |  0.32pp    | 
| 2 bar | 10m | 0.42pp   |  0.80pp    | 0.72pp    | 0.70pp    | 0.64pp    | 
| 3 bar | 20m | 0.63pp   |  1.20pp    |  1.08pp    | 1.05pp   |  0.96pp    |
| 4 bar | 30m | 0.84pp   |  1.60pp    |  1.44pp    | 1.40pp   |  1.28pp    |
| 5 bar | 40m | 1.05pp   |  2.00pp    |  1.80pp    | 1.75pp   |  1.60pp    |

{:.warning}
> pp = PO2 recommended maximum is 1.4 PO2 and the absolute 1.6 maximum is 1.6
