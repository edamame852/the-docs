# Enriched Air Diver
## Introducing EANx (Enriched Air Nitrox)
- Main goal is to increase no stop/no decompression dive time
- In the past a new table is needed for different blends of EANx to calculate the correct oxygen exposure but now computers calculate it all

{:.note}
>Jargon time: nitrox = EAN = EANx = enriched air are all used interchangably

## Diving with Nitrox
- Purpose is not to have more O2 but to have LESS N2
- EANx36 = nitrox with 36% O2 = Nitrox 36

### Benefits of using Nitrox
- Extending allowable bottom time (added no stop time in repeated dives)
- Reducing the need to suck in more air when near no decompression limit 
- Reduce overall N2 load during multiple dives

| Depth (meters)   |No decompression limit time(Air)   | No decompression limit time (EANx32)   |No decompression limit time (EANx36) |
| -------- | ------- | ------- |------- |
| 0m / on-land  | inf  | inf    |   inf    |
| 18m | 56 mins   |  95 mins     |  125 mins   |
| 22m   | 37 mins    |  60 mins    |  70 mins    | 

- DCI (Decompression sickness) rate of normal air is the same as nitrox diving, nitrox also does NOT reduce the risk for narcosis

## Gears

### Nitrox-tailored gears
- High O2 blended gas can cause equipments to deteriorate rapidly
- Typically, according to NOAA, US Navy, OSHA, ... scuba eqipuments can use up to EANx40 without any modifications
- For EANx40 and above, equipments including cylinders will be cleaned to O2 service specs, luburicated, comptaible O-rings ... is required

### Nitrox cylinders
- Is to be cleaned under local law or standards
- In US: Enriched air cylinders and regulars rated for 300 bar are O2 service rated
- In Europe: Standard requires special valve and regulators for eqipments such as the M26x2 

### Caution when using Nitrox
- 1. Mark non-nitrox and nitrox tanks seperately!
