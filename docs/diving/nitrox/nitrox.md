# Enriched Air Diver
## Introducing EANx (Enriched Air Nitrox)
- Main goal is to increase no stop/no decompression dive time
- In the past a new table is needed for different blends of EANx to calculate the correct oxygen exposure but now computers calculate it all

{:.note}
>Jargon time: nitrox = EAN = EANx = enriched air are all used interchangably

## Diving with Nitrox
- Purpose is not to have more O2 but to have LESS N2
- EANx36 = nitrox with 36% O2 = Nitrox 36

### Benefits of using Nitrox
- Extending allowable bottom time (added no stop time in repeated dives)
- Reducing the need to suck in more air when near no decompression limit (Reducing N2 affect)
- Reduce overall N2 load during multiple dives

| Depth (meters)   |No decompression limit time(Air)   | No decompression limit time (EANx32)   |No decompression limit time (EANx36) |
| -------- | ------- | ------- |------- |
| 0m / on-land  | inf  | inf    |   inf    |
| 18m | 56 mins   |  95 mins     |  125 mins   |
| 22m   | 37 mins    |  60 mins    |  70 mins    | 

- DCI (Decompression sickness) rate of normal air is the same as nitrox diving, nitrox also does NOT reduce the risk for narcosis

## Gears

### Nitrox-tailored gears
- High O2 blended gas can cause equipments to deteriorate rapidly
- Typically, according to NOAA, US Navy, OSHA, ... scuba eqipuments can use up to EANx40 without any modifications
- For EANx40 and above, equipments including cylinders will be cleaned to O2 service specs, luburicated, comptaible O-rings ... is required

### Nitrox cylinders
- Is to be cleaned under local law or standards
- In US: Enriched air cylinders and regulars rated for 300 bar are O2 service rated
- In Europe: Standard requires special valve and regulators for eqipments such as the M26x2 

### Caution when using Nitrox
- 1. Mark non-nitrox and nitrox tanks seperately!


## Nitrox class

### Nitrox license pros and cons:

pros:
- longer no decompression limit (NDL)
- longer and deeper dives
- N2 sickness
- can replace emergency O2 
- Feels better

limit for nitrox: 
- N2 saturation
- ran out of gas

cons:
- Oxygen posioning
- Fire hazard
- More expansive
- rest time higher
- Storage fee
- Maintance fee (eqipment)

### Causes for NDL
- Fast ascend
- Over NDL time

Gas necrosis: includes both N2 and O2
- Whereas the canto version only includes Nitrogen
- will lower ciritcal thinking

### Shit diving watch
- Taiwan Atom mission 1 = no warning for NDL

### Nitrox eqipments
High O2 environment = more oxidization
- Green O ring
- Yellow bottle, green-yellow sticker 
- oxygen clean service sticker (NEVER SEEN)
- Enriched Air filled data sticker from PADI (NEVER SEEN) : Typically, just a normal sticker with marker
- Black and white strips at the top

- PADI Tec Gas Blender license 

### Nitrox percentage
- 32% (More common)
- 36%

### Oxygen exposure

In different pressure, different performence of gases

PO2 and pp (They're the same)
1 bar *0.21 = 0.21 pp (in normal pressure)

We cannot exceed 1.4 and 1.6
- 1.4 ata/bar = no chance of O2 positioning, the risk occurs after 1.4
- 1.6 ata/bar = potentially O2 posioning
- after 1.6 ata/bar = definately Oxygen posioning

### Oxygen posioning
- CNS posioning (immdiately)
    - Will lead to seizures (in the face), regulator gets loose and suffocate and die
-  Symptoms (6 of them):
    - tunnel vision
    - seizure
    - anxiety
    - dizzyness
    - ear blaring
    - tendency to vomit

Please contact your buddy and perform a normal ascend

### Control O2 exposure
- Set computer and dive within limit
- Know your pp/ po2 limit

### O2 analysis form (Enriched Air Fill log)
- Must be filled every dive
    - Cylinder number (around the rim, but there's usually another common number written by the dive shop)
    - date where diver receives container
    - dive shop name/ dive operation
    - oxygen analysis (final nitrox percentage)
    - blender's name 
    - Max depth @ 1.4 
    - cylinder pressure
    - divers name
    - diver's signiture 
- Tuner (set oxygen percentage first), blow the nitrox to the o-ring and try = analysis done
