# Unit 1

## Pressure
### Conversion between bar and ata

{:.note }
> 1 bar = 1 ata

| Depth (meters)   |Depth (feet)   | Pressure  |Air Volume  |Air Volume change w/ ground | Air density  |
| -------- | ------- | ------- |------- |------- |------- |
| 0m / on-land  | 0 feet   |  1 bar    |   1    | 0%    |  x 1    |
| 10m | 33 feet   |  1 bar    |  1/2    | -50%   |  x 2    |
| 20m   | 66 feet    |  1 bar    |  1/3    |  -66%    | x 3    |

Facts 1: 
- Water is incompressible, so its VOLUME and DENSITY does not vary with pressure
- Gas is the total opposite
- Hence gas pressure affeects your ears, sinuses, lungs, diving mask and dry suit

### Eqaulizing pressure

Equalizing mask = blow air from nose to mask
if failed, will cause nose and eye surrounding to swell up

If equalizing fails:
- try ascend until pain goes away then equalize and dive again

{:.warning}
> Do not dive under medication, during fever or having an allergy attack. Since all listed illness lead to nasil inflammation, more blockage for normal airflow and makes equalizing harder

{:.warning}
> Do NOT dive with everyday earplugs, it could lead to uneqaulizable situations
