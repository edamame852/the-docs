## Pressure
### Conversion between bar and ata

{:.note }
> 1 bar = 1 ata

| Depth (meters)   |Depth (feet)   | Pressure  |Air Volume  |Air Volume change w/ ground | Air density  |
| -------- | ------- | ------- |------- |------- |------- |
| 0m / on-land  | 0 feet   |  1 bar    |   1    | 0%    |  x 1    |
| 10m | 33 feet   |  1 bar    |  1/2    | -50%   |  x 2    |
| 20m   | 66 feet    |  1 bar    |  1/3    |  -66%    | x 3    |

Facts 1: 
- Water is incompressible, so its VOLUME and DENSITY does not vary with pressure
- Gas is the total opposite
- Hence gas pressure affeects your ears, sinuses, lungs, diving mask and dry suit

### Eqaulizing pressure

Equalizing mask = blow air from nose to mask
if failed, will cause nose and eye surrounding to swell up

If equalizing fails:
- try ascend until pain goes away then equalize and dive again

{:.warning}
> Do not dive under medication, during fever or having an allergy attack. Since all listed illness lead to nasil inflammation, more blockage for normal airflow and makes equalizing harder

{:.warning}
> Do NOT dive with everyday earplugs, it could lead to uneqaulizable situations

{:.warning}
> It's rare but diving might cause teeth patched gaps discomforts
> The same discomfort may also happen to your **wet suit** mid dive due to the air between your body and the suit

Q: What happens to your lungs during a dive?
Ans: Your lung collapases with pressure and with depth.

Note:
- You dont need to equalize your lungs since lungs have a high volume
- The only danger only arise in 2 scenarios
    - 1: You exhale completely and begin your dive
    - 2: You hold your breathe & dive to 60m +  
- You don't typically equalize during ascend due to pressure from your inards to outards is a natural human process

### Dos and Don't

1. NEVER hold your breath during a dive
- Say you hold your breath and ascend, your lungs over-expand and could lead to rupture. Causing air to enter your chest cavity and bloodstream and results in paralysis or depth

2. DON'T dive when your lung is inflammed, due to the air trapped in lungs will over-expand

3. DON'T dive during a flu, after flu med, your bloodflow increases and adds more internal pressure to your body and ends up in your ears or nasal cavity.

4. DON'T dive after eating food that produces a lot of gas! During ascend, ga expand = cauing discomfort

### Breathing and buoyancy


1. Diving depth increases = pressure increase = gas task volumn decrease = gas intake increase
    - This results in higer gas consumption in deeper areas
    - Since deeper you dive, the closer gas molecules are together, makes it harder to breath and you breath more as a result
