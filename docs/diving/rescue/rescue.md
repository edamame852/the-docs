## Section 1
### 1.1 Intro
Scnerio: Low on air, signaled buddy, buddy ok and up reluctantly

- Surfaced at starboard (right side), swam against current
- Thomas is very week, cannot signal

Questions to consider:
- What causes diving emergencies
- What is stress
- When is stress good and when is it not so much so it starts causing problems
- How to determine the nature of emergency
- Who is present 

### 1.2 Psychology of Rescue I
> In case of emergencies, first thing to do is to stop + think

- Cause of diver emergencies:
    - Poor Judgetment 
        - Most accidents are preventable
        - Series of poor decisions = trouble
        - Mitigation plan: 
            - plan a dive and perform risk assessment
            - factor in potential hazards (currents, waves, harmful organisms in water), how to handle them
            - double check equipments
        - Poor judgements examples:
            - No cave diving cert and cave dived
            - Ignoring raising current
            - Continue to dive when equipments looks to have trival malfunctions

- 3 considerations before trying to rescue
- Very important point: Protect yourself first
    - Point of Consideration 1: If you're not in water, do you need to enter? Reach the person with an extension, nearby small boar, floation devices may be better then jumping into the water head on
    - Point of Consideration 2: If in-water rescue is a must, do you have the right eqiupment and training to help ?
    - Point of Consideration 3: If in-water rescue is a must, can u save ppl without endangering yourself, resonable to accept risk, 

Quiz:
1. Most Common cause of diver emergencies? Ans: Poor Judgement
2. The first thing to consider before attempting an inwater rescue is how fast you should swim. Ans: No, False.

### 1.3 Recognizing Diver Stress
- Direct cause of emergency = Stress
    - Stess = physical or mental tension
    - Up side: Stronger, more pain tolerance, think faster
    - Down side: flee response, overwhelm and lead to misjudgements
- Psychological Stress
    - Cause: Diver's perception of threats
- Quiz:
    - 1: Diver stress is...the physical and psychological responses to a perceived threat.
    - 2: Cause of physical stress... cold & hear + fatigue
    - 3: CAuse of psychological stress...task loading, peer pressure
    - 4: Perceptual narrowing is the tendency under stress to be less broadly aware and more focused on a perceived threat and/or solutions to that threat. Ans is True
    - 5: The effects of stress on a diver can include (choose all that apply). Ans is all
        - anxiety.
        - perceptual narrowing.
        - increased breathing.
        - panic.

### 1.4 Be prepared for emergency (Part I)
- Prep a first aid kit:
    - Sunscreen, Nasal Decognestant spray with Doctor's approval. 
- Rescue Breathing mask
- Quiz:
    - 1. A well-stocked first-aid kit is intended to help manage small problems, and to stabilize major problems until reaching emergency medical care. Ans: True
    - 2. A rescue breathing mask is something a rescuer wears to prevent disease transmission. Ans: False
    - 3.s Advantages of a rescue breathing mask include that (choose all that apply)
        - Ans include:
            - simplifies making an effective seal.
            - it reduces disease transmission risk.
            - you can use it for inwater rescue breathing.
            - you can provide oxygenated rescue breaths with it.

## 1.5 Emergency Oxygen Delivery Systems
- Positive Pressure Resuscitator Oxygen Systems = supplying 100% pure oxygen

- Quiz:
    - 1. It’s important to have emergency oxygen available because prompt oxygen first aid can make a difference in the case of decompression sickness, lung overexpansion injury or drowning. Ans: True
    - 2. The three primary types of emergency oxygen systems include (choose all that apply)
        - positive pressure resuscitator systems.
        - continuous flow systems.
        - nonresuscitator demand valve systems.
    - 3. _______________ work much like a scuba regulator, supplying 100 percent oxygen when the diver inhales. Ans: 	Nonresuscitator demand valve systems
    - 4. The emergency oxygen systems suitable for use by PADI Rescue Divers include
        - 	continuous flow systems.
        - 	nonresuscitator demand valve systems.
    - 5. For general purposes in areas with ready access to emergency medical services, an emergency oxygen supply of 40 to 50 minutes is normal. Ans: True
