# 1. Interview Questions (& ans)

## Describe React
- Popular opinion: Lib rather than framework (since not next.js)
- React lib using js/ts to create UI interfaces

## What's JSX
- Not directly coding in CSS, html..., We code with JSX
- JSX the template language for react = creating html dynamically = putting js into html
- Benefit of JSX: Has the feel of html but allow to code in js (best of both worlds)
- Downside of JSX: SKIPPED

## What's the virtual dom (Document Object Model)
- Fact: React doesn't interact with the REAL dom
- React -> virtual dom (a tool that react uses) -> Real dom
