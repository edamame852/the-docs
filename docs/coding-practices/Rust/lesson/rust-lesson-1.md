## Background of Rust:

### Benefits of Rust
#### Statically and strongly typed (like TS lmao):
Statically declared types: Code type gets checked at <b>complie</b> time
Strongly Type: Code type gets checked at <b>runtime</b>, code will follow strict type rule
{:.note}
#### Complied Lanaguage:
Unlike python, Ruby, JS it requires their respective intepreter to be installed in the env to run thier code.
Rust is able to directly complie down to a binary executable machine code (aka even those that don't have Rust installed)
