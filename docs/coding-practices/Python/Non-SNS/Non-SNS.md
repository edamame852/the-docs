# Dunner variables

>FYI, there are a few dunner methods/ variables <br/>
> You can find them via `print(dir())` <br/>
> These are the listed ones: <br/>
> `__annotations__, __builtins__, __cached__, __doc__, __file__, __loader__, __name__, __package__, __spec__`

## Without using `if __name__ == "__main__"`

- Running python file directly 
```python
print(__name__) # returns __main__

# Explained: When running python file directly, __name__ is set to main
```

- Running python file via import <br/>

fileA
```python
print(__name__) # returns __main__

# Explained: When running python file directly, __name__ is set to main
```

fileB
```python
import fileA # returns fileA

#Explained: Since fileB imported fileA, meaning fileA was ran once through fileB
```

- Running python file via import methods without `if __name__ == "__main__"` <br/>

fileA
```python
def do_something():
    print('doing something')

do_something() # Prints doing something

# Explained: When running python file directly with do_something(), it prints doing something
```

fileB
```python
from fileA import do_something # returns 1st print statement

do_something() # This returns the 2nd print statments

#Explained: Since fileB imported fileA, meaning fileA was ran once through fileB, then ran again
```

## Using `if __name__ = "__main__"`

fileA
```python
def do_something():
    print('doing something')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    do_something() # Prints doing something

# Explained: When running python file directly with do_something(), it prints doing something
```

fileB
```python
from fileA import do_something # returns nothing!
# This is because do_something is invokes and it's not equal to __main__, it's equal to fileA, ergo, no print statements! 

do_something() # This returns the 1st print statment!

#Explained: 
```

# `@` decoraters in Python

## `@timing` 

You can implement your own decorator and put this module in your utils/timing.py

```python
import time

def timing(f):
    def wrap(*args, **kwargs):
        time1=time.time()

        ret=f(*args, **kwargs)

        time2=time.time()
        time_took = time2-time1
        args[0]._logger.info(f"The {f.__name__} method took {time_took} seconds to generate ")
        return ret
    return wrap


```
