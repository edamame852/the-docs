# Terminologies
1. `kubectl` = The k8s command line tool
2. container = container runs inside of pods!
    - Containers are lightweight, standalone 
3. service = a k8s resource that provides stable network endpoint (IP & DNS Name) to access a set of pods, enabling communication between pods/ with outside network
4. k8s (API) resources = all k8s objects, entites manged by API resources (e.g. deployments, pods, services...etc)
5. k8s API server = kubectl commands go to here; API Server = centeral management component in the k8s cluster = frontend of the k8s control plane 
6. Ingress vs Egress
    - Similarity: Both are used to describe flow of network traffic from pods to someone else/ some other resources (e.g. pod/ services) 
    - Difference:  
        - ingress: incoming traffic (from external to pod) = who can talk to your pod = into cluster/pod/services
            - example:
                - how users access app from the internet
        - egress: Outgoing traffic (from pod to external) = who your pod can talk to = out of cluster/pod/services
            - example: 
                - pod calls an external API 
                - pod calls an external DB

# Questions
33. Which of the following are valid reasons for using k8s?
- Options:
    - k8s automates high avaliability and DR (Disater Recovery)
    - :heavy_check_mark: k8s automates the scheduling, starting, stopping, and updating of containers
        - Explanation: k8s auto start, stop, scale, update containerized apps and makes deployment easy :D
    - :heavy_check_mark: All apps deployed to k8s can be scaled by deafult, based on memory and cpu consumption
        - Explanation: k8s has horizontal scaling (e.g. on mem and cpu  usages) handling muliple workloads without manual involvement
    - :heavy_check_mark: K8s automates container patching + ensures the latest common vulns exposures (CVE) are fixed
        - Explanation: k8s has features like auto rolling updates = to patch security loopholes and update containers. k8s has eco-system to include tools and vlun scanning and monitoring
    - Containers deployed to k8s are automatically secured.

34. Which of the following CANNOT be performed with network policies in k8s?
- 5 Options:
    - Only accepting connections from frontend pods
    - :heavy_check_mark: Forcing internal cluster traffic to go through a common gateway
        - This cannot be done through NetworkPolicies since NetworkPolicy enforce L3 and L4 layer rules (accept/deny) and doesn't change routing/ force traffic through a particular hop
    - Specify the allowed protocols (TCP, UDP, SCTP) and port numbers
    - Deny all ingress and all egress traffic by default
    - Only accept connections from pods within the same namespace

35. Which commands will list all avaliable API resources in k8s?
- Options:
    - `kubectl api-objects` : No such command
    - `kubectl get api-resources`: No such command
    - :heavy_check_mark: `kubectl api-resources`: listing all resource types in the k8s api server
    - `kubectl get all`: Listing all core types in the ns
    - `kubectl describe api-resources` : No such command

36. How does a k8s container discover a service?
- Facts:
    - k8s container relys on 2 things to perform service discovery: DNS entries + injecting ENV vars into pod during pod creation
    - k8s container manager doesn't exist
    - Dockerfile contains instructions to build (container) image, it does not help configure anything k8s related 
- Choices:
    - :heavy_check_mark: For every service.yaml, an env variable inside the container gets created containing the IP address of the service
        - Correct: Since k8s **auto-injects** env var into each pod for every service in the same namespaces. These envs include service cluster IP & port number. Hence containers can discover services via env vars!
    - By using k8s container manager
    - Which services are avaliable for the container are all configured in the deployment
    - It's specified in the container's Dockerfile which services are avaliable
    - :heavy_check_mark: Every service has a DNS entry which can be used to connect to the service
        - Correct: Since k8s creates a DNS entry per service, hence the dns names can help connect to services within the cluster
