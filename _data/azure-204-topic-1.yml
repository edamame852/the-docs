      question: "Q3 (Topic 1): <br/>
      You have an AKS (Azure k8s Service) Cluster that is managed by an AD joined device. <br/>
      The cluster is located in a resource group. <br/>
      Devs made a MyApp and it's packaged into a container image. <br/>
      We need to deploy the yml (manifest) file to the AKS cluster. <br/>
      Is `kubectl apply -f myapp.yml` good enough to deploy?"
      items:
          - choice: Yeah
            correct: true
          - choice: Nah
            correct: false
      followup: "The solution provided involves using kubectl, which is the Kubernetes command-line tool, to apply the YAML manifest file (myapp.yaml) for deploying the application. Since you're managing the AKS cluster from an Azure AD-joined device and have the Azure CLI installed, running kubectl apply -f myapp.yaml command will deploy the application to the AKS cluster. This is a common and valid method for deploying applications to Kubernetes clusters, including AKS. Therefore, option A is correct"
